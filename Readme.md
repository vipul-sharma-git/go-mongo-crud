### Our REST API

    In this example we want to create simple REST actions: 
        1. Getting all users (GET)
        2. Getting one user (GET)
        3. Saving an user (POST) 
        4. Removing an user (DELETE)
        5. Updating an user (PUT).

We follow a classic REST URL convention, as you can see below.

# Run Server
    By default, the application will be listening on port 3000 and simply open a web browser to `http://<server>/:8080`
